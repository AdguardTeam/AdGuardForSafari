# AdGuard for Safari

Ad blocking extensions for Safari are having hard time since Apple [started to force everyone](https://adguard.com/en/blog/safari-adblock-extensions/) to use the new SDK. AdGuard extension is supposed to bring back the high quality ad blocking back to Safari.

Unlike other major ad blockers, AdGuard provides some extra features you are used to have with the traditional (now deprecated) extensions:

* Managing protection from Safari
* Choose among popular filter subscription
* Custom filters
* Creating your own filtering rules
* Manual blocking tool
* Whitelisting websites

AdGuard for Safari is based on the Safari native content blocking API, which makes it lightning fast, but somewhat limited in capabilities. For instance, Safari limits the number of rules a content blocker can have.

## Better yet, there is a full-fledged AdGuard for Mac

With all above said, there is a solution that is even more effective than AG Safari extension. I mean, of course, [AdGuard for Mac](https://adguard.com/adguard-mac/overview.html). It can:

* filter your traffic in all browsers and apps on your Mac
* have an unlimited number of filter rules
* provide a better filtering quality (due to the lack of browser API restrictions)

You can [try it out for free](https://adguard.com/en/download.html?os=mac&show=1).

## How to build AdGuard for Safari

AdGuard for Safari consists of three parts:

* An [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) application.
* Safari Content Blocker extension
* Safari Toolbar icon extension

### Prerequisites

- MacOS 10.13 or above
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 12.2 or above
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v13.10.0 or higher
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
- [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

Also, you need to install these packages globally:

- [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager)
- [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)
- [electron-osx-sign](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-osx-sign)

```
yarn global add electron-packager
yarn global add node-gyp
yarn global add electron-osx-sign
```

## How to build

### To run application in development mode

```
cd ElectronMainApp
```

Install local dependencies by running:

```
yarn install
```

### How to debug the app

#### Debug window

Launch the application via:
```
yarn start
```
Open menu `View -> Toggle Developer Tools`

#### Debug main process

Launch the application via
```
yarn inspect
```
Open URI `chrome://inspect` in Chromium

Then add a network target `localhost:5858` via button "Configure" and select this target below.

#### Build and run in production mode

Replace the following line in file `./AdGuard/Config.xcconfig`
```
AG_SIGN = <YOUR APPLE DEVELOPER COMMON NAME>
```
where `<YOUR APPLE DEVELOPER COMMON NAME>` is your codesign identity

Make sure your system Nodejs version higher v8.9.4.

Steps to check it:
if you use `nvm` run
```
nvm use system
node -v
```
otherwise
```
node -v
```

Open `AdGuard.xcworkspace` in Xcode and run building project

#### How to run tests
```
cd ElectronMainApp
yarn test
```

## Preparing and building Adguard.

### Official environment requirements

- MacOS 10.15.4+
- Xcode 12.0+
- Dev account on developer.apple.com and `Adguard Software Limited` membership, enabled `App Store Connect`
- Certificates `Developer ID Application: Adguard Software Limited (TC3Q7MAJXF)` and `Developer ID Installer: Adguard Software Limited (TC3Q7MAJXF)` in `keychain`

Check certificates names in Scripts/ExportOptions.plist. If not using Adguard certificates,

- MacOS 10.15.4+
- Xcode 12.0+
- Paid dev account on developer.apple.com
- `Developer ID Application` and `Developer ID Installer` in keychain
- Replace your Adguard certificate identifiers with your own in `Scripts/ExportOptions.plist`, `AdGuard/AdGuard/Info.plist`, `AdGuard/Config.xcconfig`, and `AdGuard/AdGuard.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`


### Building

#### SafariConverterLib dependency

For converting rules to content-blocker format we use an external library as a binary built from `https://github.com/AdguardTeam/SafariConverterLib/`, that `ConverterTool` binary should be placed in `./libs/`.

You use `./Scripts/download-lib.sh` to download the latest release version of that binary from Github.  

#### Preparation - notarization

In case we need to notarize the app, we will need to do it.

Register in `App Connect` and create a password for `altool`.
ca
> "Because App Store Connect now requires two-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts, you must create an app-specific password for altool, as described in [Using app-specific passwords](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397).
> To avoid including your password as cleartext in a script, you can provide a reference to a keychain item, as shown in the previous example. This assumes the keychain holds a keychain item named `altool_access` with an account value matching the username `dev_acc@icloud.com`. Note that altool canâ€™t access your iCloud keychain for security reasons, so the item must be in your login keychain. You can add a new keychain item using the Keychain Access app, or from the command line using the security utility:
>
> ```
> security add-generic-password -a "dev_acc@icloud.com" -w <secret_password> -s "altool_access"
> ```

Create `Scripts/.devconfig.json` with created username and keychain item.

#### Common issues
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution/resolving_common_notarization_issues


#### How to release standalone builds
- update version `package.json` and `AdGuard/standalone.xcconfig` or `AdGuard/standalone-beta.xcconfig`
- build apps
- notarize builds
- publish release on Github
- refresh `updates/updates.json` and `release.json` in gh-pages branch

#### Build application

```
./build.sh <channel> [--notarize=0]
```

Arguments:

- `<channel>` -- updates channel:
  - `mas` -- Mac App Store
  - `beta` -- standalone beta
  - `release` -- standalone release
- `[--notarize=0]` -- optional parameter to skip notarization
