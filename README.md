# AdGuard Mini for Mac

AdGuard Mini (formerly AdGuard for Safari) is the same open-source Safari extension — but redesigned, faster, and with Pro capabilities. On top of core ad-blocking power, advanced features are now available as an optional in-app purchase.

AdGuard Mini keeps all kinds of ads away from your Safari browser. It removes all visual clutter, such as banners, popups, and autoplay videos, so only the important content stays. AdGuard Mini also protects your privacy by blocking trackers to prevent unnecessary data collection.

With AdGuard Mini you can manage ad blocking directly from Safari – pause protection, allowlist websites, block elements manually, and report issues.

## Key features

* Block all kinds of ads in Safari: banners, video ads, popups, autoplay videos, and overlays
* Stop trackers and analytics beacons to protect your privacy
* Eliminate annoyances: cookie notices, social widgets, assistant windows and sticky bars
* Control everything from the Safari toolbar
* Select and block manually any element on a page 
* Choose from popular filter lists or add your own
* Create custom filtering rules with an advanced rule editor

## Pro features

* Real-time filter updates for precise ad blocking
* AdGuard Extra to handle anti-adblock scripts and complex cases
* Advanced custom filters to add any filters you wish

Pro features can be unlocked by an AdGuard Ad Blocker license, which can be obtained on our website or through in-app purchase.

## For ad blocking beyond Safari — there is full-fledged AdGuard for Mac

With all of the above being said, there is a solution that is even more effective than AdGuard Mini extension — [AdGuard for Mac](https://adguard.com/adguard-mac/overview.html). It’s an app that:

* filters traffic system-wide — that means blocking ads in all browsers and apps on your Mac, not just Safari
* provides better filtering quality in some cases (due to the lack of browser API restrictions)
* is not limited regarding the number of filtering rules

You can [try it out for free](https://adguard.com/en/download.html?os=mac&show=1).

## How to report an issue

To report an issue or submit a feature request, [go to the *Issues* section of this repository](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardMiniForMac/issues) and click *New issue* there.

>**Note:** for filter-related issues (missed ads, false positives, etc.) click the AdGuard Mini icon in Safari’s toolbar menu and select *Report an issue*, or go to ⚙️→ *Support* → *Report incorrect blocking* in the AdGuard Mini app.
